    <!--
      Constraints: Create a game that meets the following requirements:
      • Is a turn-based tactical game (like Jagged Alliance, the
      tactical part of  X-COM, etc - see also this list on Wikipedia
      and this article for inspiration).
      • Is made in client-side web technology that runs by default on the newest
      stable Chrome on Windows 10 (yes, that means HTML/CSS, JavaScript and/or
      WebAssembly).
      • The whole game fits into one .html file that is at most 20
      KB (20480 bytes) (everything, including all art, fonts, etc).
      • The text in game, if any, must be in English.
      • The game cannot be created using any
      "game maker" software or use a dedicated game engine (like RPG Maker, Unity,
      Unreal Engine, etc). Basic libraries like jQuery are fine (if, you can
      squeeze it inside the 20KB limit that is). If in doubt, ask in the comment
      section.

      Contest related rules:
      • Submission deadline is 7th of January 2018 at 11:59pm
      (23:59) CET (i.e. GMT+1).
      • Games must be submitted by sending a link to a
      downloadable package (hosted e.g. on Google Drive or something similar) to the
      following e-mail address: gynvael+winter2017@coldwind.pl (please also add a
      comment under this post that you sent an e-mail - otherwise I won't know that I
      didn't get an e-mail and can't debug it).
      • Source code and all the scripts used
      to build the game MUST be included in the submitted package (alongside the
      ready-to-test .html file). By submitting the game its author(s) agree to the
      game being re-hosted by me for anyone to download and test once the competition
      is over. I won't be doing anything weird with the game after the competition,
      but I want participants to learn from each other after the compo is over. • If
      you are using assets/sfx/music/etc created by someone else, please make sure its
      license allows you to use them for commercial purposes and redistribution.
      Please note that some licenses require proper attribution - be sure to meet
      these requirements.
